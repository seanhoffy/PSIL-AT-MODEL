# PATpath.org - CEP Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy Demand Model

A comprehensive React web application for modeling and estimating demand for psilocybin-assisted therapy (PSIL-AT) for depression treatment. This application is based on peer-reviewed research by Rab et al, 2024 and provides an interactive platform for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers to estimate treatment demand across different geographic regions.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This application implements the CEP (Cost-Effectiveness and Policy) Model for psilocybin-assisted therapy demand estimation. It allows users to:

- **Customize Input Parameters**: Adjust demographic data, exclusion criteria, and geographic-specific variables
- **Calculate Treatment Demand**: Generate estimates for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) populations
- **Generate Detailed Reports**: Create comprehensive PDF reports with all inputs and results
- **Save and Manage Models**: Store calculation history and results in user accounts

## 🚀 Key Features

### Interactive Model Calculator
- **Customizable Geographic Areas**: Input specific regions or populations
- **Adjustable Exclusion Criteria**: Modify percentages for various medical conditions
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant results with three different scenarios:
  - **Trial Eligibility**: 24% of base population
  - **Real-world Eligibility**: After applying medical exclusions
  - **Comorbid Conditions**: Accounting for psychological and health comorbidities

### User Management System
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure login via Firebase Authentication
- **Model History**: Save and retrieve previous calculations
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Access to saved models and results

### Professional Reporting
- **PDF Report Generation**: Comprehensive reports including:
  - All input parameters and assumptions
  - Detailed calculation results
  - Geographic and demographic context
  - Professional formatting for presentations and documentation

### Modern User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Material-UI Components**: Professional, accessible interface
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear workflow from landing page to results

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 19**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Professional UI component library
- **React Router**: Client-side routing and navigation
- **React PDF Renderer**: Dynamic PDF generation

### Backend & Data
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user management
- **Firestore Database**: Cloud-based data storage for user models
- **Python Model**: Core mathematical calculations (see `src/model_math.py`)

### Key Dependencies
- `@mui/material` & `@mui/icons-material`: UI components
- `@react-pdf/renderer`: PDF generation
- `react-number-format`: Formatted number inputs
- `firebase`: Authentication and database
- `react-firebase-hooks`: Firebase integration

## 📊 Model Methodology

The application implements a peer-reviewed model that:

1. **Identifies Eligible Populations**: Filters MDD and TRD populations based on validated inclusion/exclusion criteria
2. **Applies Medical Exclusions**: Accounts for conditions that contraindicate psilocybin therapy:
   - Bipolar disorder and mania
   - Active suicidal ideation
   - Cardiovascular conditions
   - Neurological disorders
   - Hepatic conditions
   - Personality disorders
3. **Considers Comorbidities**: Adjusts for psychological and health comorbidities
4. **Geographic Customization**: Allows region-specific population adjustments

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
